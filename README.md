# Website
The Source code for my personal website, you can check it out [here](https://emirsehic.co).

## Motivation
As a primarily front end developer, I am constantly testing new boundaries and going outside my comforat zone, so I wanted to create a website where I can showcase the skills that I have learnt and projects that I have worked on.

## Technologies
Simple, yet elegant. I went back to the roots of all websites and developed mine in standard HTML and CSS, basic never hurt anybody.
